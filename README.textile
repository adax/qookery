h1. Qookery: Declarative UI Building for Qooxdoo

h2(#about). About

The Qookery library allows "Qooxdoo":http://qooxdoo.org/ programmers to declare and run user interfaces through an easy to master XML language.

This project is a spinoff of "WAFFLE", the client-side web application framework used within Ergobyte for its cloud products.

It is currently under heavy development; code and APIs will change frequently, without warning and in unpredictable ways. Use with caution!

h2(#demo). Live Demo

You can discover Qookery and experiment with its features by visiting our interactive live demo

* "Qookery Demo and Playground":http://www.qookery.org/content/waffle/qookerydemo/index.html

h2(#examples). Real-life Examples

Ergobyte account management interface is built on top of Qookery. Each and every interface element, from the browser window up, is built declaratively using Qookery forms. You may read the source code of each form by using a browser debugging tool to track network requests.
