h1. Qookery: Declarative UI Building for Qooxdoo

h2(#about). About

The Qookery library helps "Qooxdoo":https://qooxdoo.org/ programmers declare and run user interfaces through an expressive XML language.

This project is a spinoff of "WAFFLE", the client-side web application framework used within Ergobyte for its cloud products.

It is currently under heavy development; code and APIs may change frequently.

h2(#examples). Real-life Examples

Below applications are using Qookery for their user interface requirements exclusively. All components, from the browser window up, are assembled and laid out declaratively via Qookery forms.
